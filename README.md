# Project Description
## Purpose
Nagios control center is a project created by the cohort consisting of the 2025 Summer Internship group dedicated to remaking Nagios Fusion with a React/Modern approach.

Nagios Control Center's purpose will be to monitor multiple instances of Nagios XI, as well as manage those instances, streamline alerts to a unified dashboard, and serve as a place where you can see all of your Nagios Information in one place. 

## Framework
Control Center is created using React with a modern approach to app design, and readability/accesibility. Core is also within the bounds of this project for the purpose of being able to effectively monitor the instances of XI that you would like to include within the Control Center. 

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
